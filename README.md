**Hi, I'm Roman 👋**

I am a software developer specializing in building integration solutions for messengers and platforms. My expertise lies in developing [web services](https://github.com/Reyzdor/go-web-gin) and applications using Go and Python that connect various systems through APIs and ensure their seamless interaction.

Currently, I design and implement comprehensive integrations for [Telegram](https://github.com/Reyzdor/main-crypto) and other communication platforms, creating bridges between business logic and user interfaces. I dedicate time to researching new interaction protocols and optimizing existing solutions to enhance their performance and reliability.

**My Projects**

Designed to help users maintain portfolio balance and make informed trading decisions through intelligent alerts. Currently in beta, built with Go for backend logic and real-time data processing.
